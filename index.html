<h2>Welcome!</h2>

<p> Thanks for visiting my site. It's the first one I've made, and I'm pretty proud of it. </p>

<p> My name is Immanuel, but I usually go by Mannes. In fact, I almost exclusively use Mannes, but it's proven too hard for non-Dutch speakers, so while I'm in the US, Immanuel it is.
 I study Media at Amsterdam University College, but am currently on exchange in Minneapolis, at the University of Minnesota.</p>

<h2>Interests</h2>

<p> I love music, and almost everything related to it. I play guitar in a post rock/metal band with some of my friends. I also started bouldering recently, and love to play squash and soccer</p>

<p> I've had various jobs in restaurants, cafes and hotels, and want to learn more about food after I graduate university. I plan to work in a coffee shop for a while, and might want to start my own food truck some day.</p>

<h2>Anything else you should know?</h2>

<p> The love of my life (so far) is my dog, Puck. We call her Kronk, after that big guy in The Emperor's New Groove. She's really old and has terrible breath, but she's a good girl.</p>
